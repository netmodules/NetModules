# NetModules: A Scalable, Abstract, Event-Driven Modular Architecture

NetModules is an abstract open-source architecture designed for constructing scalable, event-driven modular systems. Initially conceived as a basic demonstration of the Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF), it has since evolved beyond MEF to provide a robust and flexible architecture for developing cross-platform, plugin-based applications.

## Why NetModules?

Modern applications demand adaptability and modularity, and NetModules delivers precisely that by enforcing a strict event-handling paradigm. It allows developers to design highly scalable systems where:

- An **Event** strictly adheres to a predefined interface.
- A **Module** declares the capability to handle specific Event types.
- A **ModuleHost** serves as intermediary, ensuring efficient communication and delegation of event-handling responsibilities.

### Deferred Responsibility & Scalability

This architecture simplifies application scaling and future-proofing, where modifications only require changes within the event-handling modules rather than a complete system overhaul.

#### Example: Logging System Upgrade

Imagine your application currently logs data to a local file system. To migrate to an external logging service, instead of modifying every Module that logs data, you simply build or update a dedicated logging **Module**. Existing modules continue raising logging events as usual, unaware of the underlying change.

This follows the principle of **deferred responsibility**. A Module raises an Event requesting data or a function call, but it does not need to handle the request itself or understand how it is processed. Instead, another Module, designed to handle that Event type, receives and processes the request, ensuring flexibility and separation of concerns.

#### Example: Data Requests Between Modules

A Module may trigger an Event requesting certain data. This Module does **not** need to know where the data comes from or how it is processed, its only concern is receiving the required response. Another Module is responsible for handling the request and determining how and where the data is fetched or computed.

## Key Features

- **Abstract Event Handling**: Events conform to an interface, ensuring consistency and interoperability.
- **Modular Design**: Modules register their event-handling capabilities dynamically.
- **Scalability & Future Development**: Easily replace or modify event-handling modules without affecting the broader system.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Designed to function across any .NET-supported platform.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To use NetModules in your project, simply add the library via NuGet Package Manager:
```bash
Install-Package NetModules
````

### Quick Examples

Here's a basic demonstration of how to use NetModules:

### Declaring an Event
This example demonstrates an event class inheriting from the Event<I, O> structure.
```csharp
public class ExampleEventInput : IEventInput {}

public class ExampleEventOutput : IEventOutput {}

public class ExampleEvent : Event<ExampleEventInput, ExampleEventOutput>
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Your event name should be as unique as possible, as this can be used to identify and instantiate events via ModuleHost where required.
    /// Think of how Android Package naming works. E.g. "com.yourdomain.yourpackagename"
    /// </summary>
    public override EventName Name { get; } = "NetModules.GitHub.ExampleEvent";
}
```

### Handling an Event with a Module
A basic example module that handles the above Event.
```csharp
using NetModules.Events;
using NetModules.Interfaces;


[Module(Description = "A basic module for demonstration purposes.")]
public class ExampleModule : Module
{
	public override bool CanHandle(IEvent e)
	{
		return e is ExampleEvent;
	}

	public override void Handle(IEvent e)
	{
		if (e is ExampleEvent example)
		{
			// Do something with the your custom event Input and set any custom event Output where required.
			example.Handled = true;
		}
	}
}
```

### Creating and Loading a Module Host
A ModuleHost is required to manage and dispatch events to loaded modules.
```csharp
using NetModules;

class BasicModuleHost : ModuleHost
{
}

// Create a new module host
ModuleHost host = new BasicModuleHost();

// Load available modules
host.Modules.LoadModules();
```

### Dispatching an Event
Once the ModuleHost has been initialized, events can be dispatched for handling.
```csharp
using NetModules;

// Create a new chat event
var exampleEvent = new ExampleEvent
{
    Input = new ExampleEventInput()
};

host.Handle(exampleEvent);
```
Every Module that is loaded into a loaded a ModuleHost has access to the ModuleHost via the `this.Host` property. This means that any Module can dispatch any Event through `this.Host.Handle` and the event will be sent to another handling Module for processing.

### Additional Examples & Advanced Usage
Explore the [NetModules.ChatModule](https://github.com/netmodules/netmodules/tree/master/NetModules.ChatBot), which showcases the framework's modular approach through a chatbot implementation. The example demonstrates Event handling using the [NetModules.ChatModule.Events.ChatModuleEvent](https://github.com/netmodules/netmodules/tree/master/NetModules.ChatBot.Events) and the [IEvent](https://github.com/netmodules/netmodules/blob/master/netmodules/Interfaces/IEvent.cs) interface.

There are other examples in the repository, including a simple Console logging Module [(BasicConsoleLoggingModule)](https://github.com/netmodules/netmodules/blob/main/NetModules.BasicConsoleLogging/BasicConsoleLoggingModule.cs) that handles the internal [LoggingEvent](https://github.com/netmodules/netmodules/blob/main/NetModules/Events/LoggingEvent.cs) and outputs to Console, and a basic Module that demonstrates how to work with the [CancellableEvent](https://github.com/netmodules/netmodules/blob/main/NetModules/CancellableEvent.cs).
